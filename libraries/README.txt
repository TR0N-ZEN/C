Code you write in a file can use functions, variables and datatypes
that are not defined in the file you use them in.

To see what I mean in a practical way first read the file
  ./string_h/strcmp_01.c
and after that
  ./custom-library-code/listing_01.c
which will further recommend where you read further.
